# Walking Labs
Experiments playground for capturing, modeling, monitoring, predicting, and reacting over different walking scenarios.

This repo, as its name suggests, acts as a holder for different experiments in the wide spectrum of walking. Each experiment is contained on its own top level folder, named accordingly. Plus, a (required) README per experiment detailing what it covers and why its being worked on, among other specifics.
