# Step Idenfifier experiment

Towards decyphering how to be able to assist an individual during a walking session, the need to understand some mechanics becomes apparent. In this experiment, the focus sits on recognizing the walking pattern. We see in multiple HAR (Human Activity Recognition) related literature *[references-here]* that it's possible to derive this info, in much or less specificity, by locating a set of sensors in the subject's body, and measure from there.
